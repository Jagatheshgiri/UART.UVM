 UART- Universal Asynchronous Receiver and transmitter is a 
hardware device which facilitates serial transmission and reception of data. In this work presented 
here, the UART has been designed with the use of the industry standard Verilog HDL code and 
the verification of the protocol has been done using system Verilog code in UVM environment. 
The UVM based verification methodology can significantly reduce the time needed for 
verification. This communications between the two UART devices are seen to be working as per 
requirement. The UART Receiver is also capable of converting Serial data into parallel data.
